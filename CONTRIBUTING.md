# Contributing to Aetherion

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Aetherion! To maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase, please follow these guidelines.

## Coding Standards

The project follows a specific variation of C++ coding style. When in doubt, look at existing files like `GPURingBuffer.h` or `VulkanRenderer.cpp`.

### Naming Conventions

*   **Classes & Structs**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `VulkanRenderer`, `GPURingBuffer`).
*   **Methods & Functions**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `Init`, `CreateInstance`, `Allocate`).
*   **Variables**: Use hungarian notation type prefixes:
    *   `n`: Integers (`uint32_t`, `int`, etc.) -> `nBufferSize`, `nImageCount`.
    *   `b`: Booleans -> `bEnableValidationLayers`, `bIsComplete`.
    *   `f`: Floats -> `fQueuePriority`.
    *   `p`: Pointers -> `pWindow`, `pUrb`.
    *   `m_`: Prefix for class member variables -> `m_device`, `m_nImageCount`.
*   **Enums**: `PascalCase` for the type, `UPPER_CASE` for values. All enums need to start with an `E`. -> `EShaderStage`, `EPipelineStage`.

### Formatting

*   **Indentation**: Use **Tabs** for indentation.
*   **Bracing**: Egyptian style (Open brace on the same line as the statement).
    ```cpp
    /* 
        Important: All the function types must be on a new line, and
        in declarations must be in-line
    */
    void 
    MyFunction() {
        if (bCondition) {
            // Do something
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Forward Declarations**: Preferred over `#include` in headers when possible.

## Git Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for all code changes.

### Commit Format

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

*   `feat`: A new feature (e.g., `feat(renderer): add support for raytracing`).
*   `fix`: A bug fix (e.g., `fix(vulkan): resolve validation error in swapchain`).
*   `docs`: Documentation only changes.
*   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
*   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
*   `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
*   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
*   `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries.

### Example

```bash
git commit -m "feat(renderer): implement GPU-driven culling algorithm"
```

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure your code follows the coding standards.
2.  Update the documentation if necessary.
3.  Write descriptive commit messages following the Conventional Commits format.
4.  Submit your Pull Request for review.

# Pull Requests by AI

**Aetherion** is a game engine fully created by humans.

We **allow PRs and commits generated by AI**, but **AI-written code will not be merged directly**. This ensures security, quality, and consistency across the engine.

For AI-generated PRs:
- If the PR is **critical or high-priority**, we will discuss the implementation, but usually, **a human will rewrite the code** before it is merged.
- You have two options when submitting an AI-generated PR:
  1. **Rewrite the code yourself** and submit it for review.
  2. **Wait for us to review it**, and a human team member will rewrite and adapt it.

Our goal is to **balance efficiency with security and quality**, ensuring every contribution meets Aetherion’s standards.
